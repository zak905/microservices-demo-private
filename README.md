# Notes for working with the application locally

- first of all, the minikube ip address needs to be added as an external ip in the [frontend-external](https://github.com/rajk95051/sampleshop/blob/master/kubernetes-manifests/frontend.yaml#L87) service
     ```
     minikube ip
     ```

     and note the ip, and then

     ```
     kubectl edit svc front-end-external
     ```
     and add this, right under the  clusterIP
     ```
    externalIPs:
    - 192.168.99.100
     ```
     where 192.168.99.100 is the minkube ip

     now it should be possible to access the front end from the browser at 192.168.99.100

- it is better to remove all cpus requirements from the [kubernetes manifests](https://github.com/rajk95051/sampleshop/tree/master/kubernetes-manifests) because the resources on a personal workstation may be limited, and situations where kubernetes will not find as much resources as specified are probable. There may be times whre kubernetes will put some pods on PENDING (usually because resources are not enough), so the app may not work as expected.  
- when launching minikube, allocate at least 6 GB of memory. e.g:  `minikube start --memory 6288`

# Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application

This project contains a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app called **“Hipster Shop”** where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate Kubernetes, GKE, Istio,
Stackdriver, gRPC, OpenCensus** and similar cloud-native technologies.

> **Note to Googlers:** Please fill out the form at
[go/microservices-demo](http://go/microservices-demo) if you are using this
application.

## Service Architecture

**Hipster Shop** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

[![Architecture of
microservices](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)

Find **Protocol Buffers Descriptions** at the [`./pb` directory](./pb).

| Service | Language | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| [frontend](./src/frontend) | Go | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |
| [cartservice](./src/cartservice) |  C# | Stores the items in the user's shipping cart in Redis and retrieves it. |
| [productcatalogservice](./src/productcatalogservice) | Go | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products. |
| [currencyservice](./src/currencyservice) | Node.js | Converts one money amount to another currency.  Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| [paymentservice](./src/paymentservice) | Node.js | Charges the given credit card info (hypothetically😇) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID. |
| [shippingservice](./src/shippingservice) | Go | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (hypothetically😇) |
| [emailservice](./src/emailservice) | Python | Sends users an order confirmation email (hypothetically😇). |
| [checkoutservice](./src/checkoutservice) | Go | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification. |
| [recommendationservice](./src/recommendationservice) | Python | Recommends other products based on what's given in the cart. |
| [adservice](./src/adservice) | Java | Provides text ads based on given context words. |
| [loadgenerator](./src/loadgenerator) | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend. |


## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Stackdriver APM](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Installation

> **Note:** that the first build can take up to 20-30 minutes. Consequent builds
> will be faster.

### Option 1: Running locally with “Docker for Desktop”

> 💡 Recommended if you're planning to develop the application.

1. Install tools to run a Kubernetes cluster locally:

   - kubectl (can be installed via `gcloud components install kubectl`)
   - Docker for Desktop (Mac/Windows): It provides Kubernetes support as [noted
     here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/).
   - [skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/#installation)

2. Launch “Docker for Desktop”. Go to Preferences:
   - choose “Enable Kubernetes”,
   - set CPUs to at least 3, and Memory to at least 6.0 GiB

3. Run `kubectl get nodes` to verify you're connected to “Kubernetes on Docker”.

4. Run `skaffold run` (first time will be slow, it can take ~20-30 minutes).
   This will build and deploy the application. If you need to rebuild the images
   automatically as you refactor he code, run `skaffold dev` command.

5. Run `kubectl get pods` to verify the Pods are ready and running. The
   application frontend should be available at http://localhost:80 on your
   machine.

### Option 2: Running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

> 💡  Recommended for demos and making it available publicly.

1. Install tools specified in the previous section (Docker, kubectl, skaffold)

1. Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and make sure `kubectl` is pointing
   to the cluster.

        gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com

        gcloud container clusters create demo --enable-autoupgrade \
            --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=3 --max-nodes=10 --num-nodes=5 --zone=us-central1-a

        kubectl get nodes

1. Enable Google Container Registry (GCR) on your GCP project and configure the
   `docker` CLI to authenticate to GCR:

       gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com

       gcloud auth configure-docker -q

1. In the root of this repository, run `skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]`,
   where [PROJECT_ID] is your GCP project ID.

   This command:
   - builds the container images
   - pushes them to GCR
   - applies the `./kubernetes-manifests` deploying the application to
     Kubernetes.

   **Troubleshooting:** If you get "No space left on device" error on Google
   Cloud Shell, you can build the images on Google Cloud Build: [Enable the
   Cloud Build
   API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com),
   then run `skaffold run -p gcb  --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]` instead.

1.  Find the IP address of your application, then visit the application on your
    browser to confirm installation.

        kubectl get service frontend-external

    **Troubleshooting:** A Kubernetes bug (will be fixed in 1.12) combined with
    a Skaffold [bug](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/issues/887)
    causes load balancer to not to work even after getting an IP address. If you
    are seeing this, run `kubectl get service frontend-external -o=yaml | kubectl apply -f-`
    to trigger load balancer reconfiguration.

### (Optional) Deploying on a Istio-installed GKE cluster

> **Note:** you followed GKE deployment steps above, run `skaffold delete` first
> to delete what's deployed.

1. Create a GKE cluster (described above).

2. Use [Istio on GKE add-on](https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/installing)
   to install Istio to your existing GKE cluster.

       gcloud beta container clusters update demo \
           --zone=us-central1-a \
           --update-addons=Istio=ENABLED \
           --istio-config=auth=MTLS_PERMISSIVE

   > NOTE: If you need to enable `MTLS_STRICT` mode, you will need to update
   > several manifest files:
   >
   > - `kubernetes-manifests/frontend.yaml`: delete "livenessProbe" and
   >   "readinessProbe" fields.
   > - `kubernetes-manifests/loadgenerator.yaml`: delete "initContainers" field.

3. (Optional) Enable Stackdriver Tracing/Logging with Istio Stackdriver Adapter
   by [following this guide](https://cloud.google.com/istio/docs/istio-on-gke/installing#enabling_tracing_and_logging).

4. Install the automatic sidecar injection (annotate the `default` namespace
   with the label):

       kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled

5. Apply the manifests in [`./istio-manifests`](./istio-manifests) directory.

       kubectl apply -f ./istio-manifests

    This is required only once.

6. Deploy the application with `skaffold run --default-repo=gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]`.

7. Run `kubectl get pods` to see pods are in a healthy and ready state.

8. Find the IP address of your istio gateway Ingress or Service, and visit the
   application.

       INGRESS_HOST="$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')"

       echo "$INGRESS_HOST"

       curl -v "http://$INGRESS_HOST"
